# Deepfake Detection: Identifying Manipulated Videos and Images


## Overview

This project focuses on detecting deepfake videos and manipulated facial images using advanced deep learning models. The dataset consists of various deepfake samples generated through multiple face manipulation techniques. Our approach utilizes CNNs and transformers for feature extraction and classification, providing high accuracy in distinguishing real and fake content.

## Server Status

Our servers are operational and all dataset downloads are functioning as expected. If you encounter any issues, please report them in the issues section.

## What is New

### Advanced Deepfake Detection Model:
We have developed and fine-tuned a robust deepfake detection model leveraging state-of-the-art architectures. Our model effectively identifies fake videos generated by different face manipulation techniques.

### Deepfake Dataset:
Our dataset consists of thousands of manipulated videos collected from various sources, including AI-generated faces, GAN-based swaps, and altered facial expressions. The dataset is structured to facilitate training and benchmarking.

### Real-Time Detection Pipeline:
A new real-time inference pipeline has been added, allowing users to upload videos and receive instant deepfake classification results.
